<b>DATASET INFORMATION</b>
The dataset used in this project was officially provided by the Government of India for a hackathon and is not publicly distributable.<br>

Due to data usage and licensing constraints, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.<br>

However, the complete data processing, analysis, visualization, and machine learning pipeline is fully implemented and reproducible with authorized access to the dataset.<br>
